# instructlab-synthesizer
An experiment towards incorporating instruction synthesizer into  InstructLab

By setting your MODEL_PATH in a .env file to pickup some [GGUF](https://huggingface.co/QuantFactory/instruction-synthesizer-GGUF) of [instruction-synthesizer](https://huggingface.co/instruction-pretrain/instruction-synthesizer), you can have a semi-automated path twoards creating knowledge and potentially skills to end up in InstructLab [Taxonomy](https://github.com/instructlab/taxonomy)

Install from the requirements file, kick off the run script and post issues into the repo!

To be converted into a Podman AI recipe and leverage their model serving service at some point :)
